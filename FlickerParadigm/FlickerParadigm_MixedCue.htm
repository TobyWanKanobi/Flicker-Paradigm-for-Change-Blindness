<p>In this part of the test, you <i>sometimes</i> get a <b>hint</b> that will let you know whether to look out for a change in location of an object, 
a change in the color of an object, or whether an object was added/removed from the picture.</p></br>
<p>Otherwise the task is the same as before:</p>
<p>You will see a flickering presentation of pictures that contain one change.</p><br/ >
<p><b>TASK</b>: Press the <%values.responsekey_label%> as soon as you notice the change; otherwise the flicker cycle continues for up to
<%values.max_cycleduration/1000%> s </p><br/ >
<p>If you noticed the change a textbox will pop up and you are asked to describe the change in more detail; otherwise a new
flicker cycle will begin.</p></br></br>
