<p>To study people's awareness of changes in pictures you will be presented with cycles of flickering images: for each flicker cycle the same picture is used.
However, half the time the picture is presented in its original version and half the time the picture is altered.</p>
<p>The changes are minimal and there is only <b>one</b> change per picture.</p>
<p>The change can be a <u>location</u> change of an object, a <u>color</u> change of an object or the <u>addition/removal</u> of an object entirely.</p><br/ >
